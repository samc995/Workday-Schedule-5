## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- Make a calendar that would allow for hourly tasks in real time.
- This was built to keep better track of tasks that needed to be completed thoughout the day.
- It solves having to go to various calendars to keep my schedule and tasks managed.
- I learned about CDN and how that can be utalized for future projects.

## Usage

This calendar was created to keep track of daily tasts that will update by the hour and change color according to the time of day. Grey is past, red is present and green is future. The tasks can be saved locally and will not dissappear if you refresh the webpage so you don't lose any important information. Finally the date updates and will appear at the top under the header to keep you organized and top of your tasks.
